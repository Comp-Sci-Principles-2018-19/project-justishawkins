# Project Name: 
Overpopulation


## Problem
Every second, we get closer to the maximum carrying capacticity of earth which is said to be about nine to ten billion people. This problem is caused by factors such as increase in births, a decreasing mortality rate, and also a decrease in resources to the point where the amount of resources can't suffice for a given population. We are currently at a population of about seven billion people, closing in on our capacity. The amount of resources available on earth is the main reason why overpopulation is a problem. 

## Big Fat Idea


## First Agile Iteration
Take into account the number of the current population and how much resources that amount consumes in a year, the number at which people die in a year, and also the number at which babies are born in a year. Since an increase in the population means that the birth rate is greater than the mortality rate, take the birth rate and subtract it by the mortality rate then add the number you got to the current population. Once the difference between the original population and the population added to the amount of births is found, Repeat this within a five year span, average the amounts of the growth in population to find the rate at which the population increases. This will allow you know how much resources you will need based on how the population grows on average.
User enters current population and population from previous year, and number of years in between. Program returns the growth rate per year.
