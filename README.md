# Project Name: 
Overpopulation


## Problem
Every second, we get closer to the maximum carrying capacticity of ewarth which is said to be about nine to ten billion people. This problem is caused by factors such as increase in births, immigrations, a decreasing mortality rate, and also a decrease in resources to the point where the amount of resources can't suffice for a given population. We are currently at a population of about seven billion people, closing in on our capacity. The amount of resources available on earth is the main reason why overpopulation is a problem.
